A software engineer who would like to learn one or two new things daily. Currently, I am learning Golang, Networking and System Programming.

In my spare time, I contribute to open source projects related to Kubernetes and Golang

- Part of core team in [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium).
- Help to review, release and maintain [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).
- Top individual contributor (apart from maintainers) in [eksctl](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:pr+repo:weaveworks/eksctl+author:sayboras).
- Contribute to k8s related projects:
    - [minikube](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:pr+org:kubernetes+author:sayboras)
    - [kind](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:pr+org:kubernetes+author:sayboras)
